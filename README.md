# ComputerControl
A windows utility that fills the void where the shut down button in Windows 8 used to be.

## Purpose
Windows 8 was a shock to us all. I couldn't stand back and let it humiliate us. I had to fight back... 

Then, ComputerControl was born. 

Regain the human right of having a way to shut down your computer with this little utility app!

## Install
Put ComputerControl.exe somewhere you will forget, create a shortcut and pin it to your taskbar for maximum nostalgia. 

## Use
It's modelled after long forgotten operating systems like Windows 7, so it's really easy to use. Just double click it (single if it's pinned to your taskbar!), and you have all the wonderful options for controlling your computer at your cursor tip.
